#English
# 1. I started the application with Docker Compose:

docker compose up -d --build

# The following warning appeared (it is harmless) and the build/log output indicated the container was started:
time="2025-07-21T21:15:21+03:00" level=warning msg="...docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion"

✔ Container hello-world-app  Started

# 2. I checked the output from the container:

docker compose logs

# Output:
hello-world-app  | Hello, World!

# 3. I shut down the Compose services when done:

docker compose down
